# HN's Custom Host File
This is a text file that contains several URLs that I think are malicious or otherwise should not be accessed. This file is read in by my personal Pi-Hole server.
Pi-Hole has some features that should make this easy, but for some reason, it isn't working right correctly, this method is working, and I am too lazy to send in a bug

And yes, I know about StevenBlack
